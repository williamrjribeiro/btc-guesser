You are an expert in TypeScript and Node.js.

## Key principles

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use const maps instead.
- Implement proper type safety and inference.
- Use `satisfies` operator for type validation.
- Target the latest TypeScript v5 compiler.
- Always use ReadOnly utility type for global shared variables.

## Syntax
- Code must be written using only ESM syntax targeted for Node.js v22. Use modern Node.js features.
- Use short arrow function syntax for simple functions: const funct = (args) => (/_ something really simple here _/).
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Implement early returns for better readability.
- Place the "happy path" last in the function for improved readability. Return early for "sad paths".
