# Crypto Guesser Requirements

A web app that allows users to make guesses on whether the market price of Bitcoin (BTC/USD) will be higher or lower after one minute.

## Rules

- The player can at all times see their current score and the latest available BTC price in USD
- The player can choose to enter a guess of either “up” or “down“
- After a guess is entered, the player cannot make new guesses until the existing guess is resolved
- The guess is resolved when the price changes and at least 60 seconds have passed since the guess was made
- If the guess is correct (up = price went higher, down = price went lower), the user gets 1 point added to their score. If the guess is incorrect, the user loses 1 point.
- Players can only make one guess at a time
- New players start with a score of 0
- Players should be able to close their browser and return back to see their score and continue to make more guesses

## Solution requirements

- The guesses should be resolved fairly using BTC price data from any available 3rd party API
- The score of each player should be persisted in a backend data store (AWS services preferred)
